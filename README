1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
	I passed all of the online tests with one warning telling me to consider
adding lang="en". I would like to add css attributes for my section classes
in my resume in the future.
2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
	Derek (TA) helped me out because I accidentally initialized my git from
my home instead of the folder with all of my documents.
3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
	Around 9 or 10.
