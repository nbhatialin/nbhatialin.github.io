                        Spring 2022 to Current - Remote (NYC Based)
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        Over the past couple years working for
                        <a href="https://www.runningtide.com/">Running Tide</a>
                        I have been involved in a wide range of work â€” from
                        processing and visualizing verification buoy data to
                        carbon accounting to credit delivery. My initial
                        responsibility when joining was to take ownership and
                        rebuild our internal dashboard used for managing just
                        about everything related to ops and MRV. That project
                        evolved over time, and has culminated in a nextjs/vercel
                        monorepo supporting a number of frontend applications
                        with shared component libraries and authentication.
                        Additionally along the way I helped upgrade our API
                        services to use more uniform patterns structured around
                        TypeORM and tsoa.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Other projects and focus areas include building out our
                        deployment tracker to record and communicate carbon
                        sinking operations, creating a customer credit portal
                        with external authentication, revamping and migrating
                        our Airflow jobs to Cloud Composer, and miscellaneous
                        support for the verification hardware, machine vision,
                        and ocean modeling teams. Recently, I have also been
                        working closely with our carbon accounting team to build
                        out an internal ledger in a standardized, auditable way.

                        Fall 2021 to January 2024 - Remote (Berkeley Based)
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        From September 2021 up until this year I contracted for
                        Advance Peace to make improvements to their internal
                        platform as the program expanded with new partnerships
                        in a number of cities across the US. As of January 2024
                        I have taken a step back but am still involved in a more
                        secondary support role.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fall 2021 I primarily focused on revamping the Life
                        Management Action Plan (LifeMAP) framework AP uses to
                        help fellows set and achieve goals. I added a new way
                        for mentors to create new LifeMAPs and add goals which
                        aims to be more intuitive based on mentor feedback. In
                        addition, I streamlined the way mentors provide updates
                        on the actions for a given goal, integrating them into
                        the weekly log which mentors fill out for each fellow. I
                        also increased the ease with which mentors and admins
                        can interact with and export existing LifeMAPs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Spring 2022 I built out the data summary component of
                        the site, which conveys a number of metrics important to
                        admins and stakeholders. These additions enable a more
                        comprehensive understanding of fellows' progress over
                        time as well as the ability to better judge the impact
                        of our work by overlaying geospatial crime data with
                        mentor interventions and outreach.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Being the only software developer under contract came
                        with a number challenges, and I struggled at times with
                        the lack of support. However, it was times like these
                        when my motivation slipped that pushed me to remember
                        why I am working, and I was able to refocus knowing I am
                        helping contribute to an organization who's cause I
                        believe in. In addition, the same lack of guidance that
                        can be a source of frustration pushed me to explore and
                        learn on my own, which has set me up to be more flexible
                        and capable down the line.

                    <p>
                        The first portion of this internship was during my
                        Senior Spring, where I worked part time while also
                        completing classes. The majority of my time was spent
                        implementing minor features and fixing bugs while
                        familiarizing myself with my team's stack.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over the summer, my focus shifted to developing a
                        feature that would depict the set of comorbidities as a
                        high level overview for a selected population. I
                        integreated this feature into our platform using D3 to
                        build a bubble graph visualization and Python for the
                        computations on our stats server.

                        The TriNetX platform uses React for the frontend, Java
                        for the backend, a Python stats server, and Snowflake
                        for database management.

                    <p>
                        My primary project as a part of the Energy & Capital
                        Markets team was to rewrite their previously bug-ridden
                        Supply & Demand tool from the ground up. Given
                        historical usage and market data and the set of changes
                        to requirements and infrastructure, the aim of the tool
                        was to predict future energy demand for a region. I used
                        Python for the necessary computations and PyQt for the
                        GUI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The independent nature of this work felt very unique for
                        an internship, as I was tasked with doing technical work
                        for a non-technical team. It was over the course of this
                        project that my love for coding was truly solidified.
                        During the back half of the summer I spent pretty much
                        all day every day working on my tool - and the hours
                        would fly by. Having a job like this where I was able to
                        settle in and just <em>flow</em> helped me realize that
                        this was the work I wanted to be filling my days with in
                        the future, and when the summer ended I was sent back to
                        school more motivated and focused than ever before.

                        The Summer after my freshman year I helped one of my
                        close friends workshop the early stages of a photo print
                        product / app idea. We spent a good deal of time
                        brainstorming and product testing in a local print
                        facility, and even more time designing and implementing
                        the interface of our user app. The product offically
                        launched in October 2017, and although we were forced to
                        shut down production since none of us could commit to
                        managing the operations, you can see my friend's post
