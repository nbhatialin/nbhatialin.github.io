          <h2 class="section-heading">Advance Peace | Full Stack Developer</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Fall 2021 to Current - Remote (Boston Based)</h3>
          
          <p>Since September 2021 I have been contracting for Advance Peace to make improvements to our internal platform as the program prepares to expand, with new partnerships in a number of cities across the US.  </p>

          <p>Last fall I primarily focused on revamping the Life Management Action Plan (LifeMAP) framework AP uses to help fellows set and achieve goals. 
              I added a new way for mentors to create new LifeMAPs and add goals which aims to be more intuitive based on mentor feedback. 
              In addition, I streamlined the way mentors provide updates on the actions for a given goal, integrating them into the weekly log 
              which mentors fill out for each fellow. I also increased the ease with which mentors and admins can interact with and export existing LifeMAPs. </p>

            <p>This Spring I am building out the data summary component of the site, which conveys a number of metrics important to admins and stakeholders.
                 These additions enable a more comprehensive understanding of fellows' progress over time 
                as well as the ability to better judge the impact of our work by overlaying geospatial crime data with mentor interventions and outreach. 
            </p>

            <p>Being the only software developer under contract comes with a number challenges, and I have struggled at times with the lack of 
                support. However, it's times like these when my motivation is slipping that push me to remember why I am working, 
                and I am able to refocus knowing I am helping contribute to an organization who's cause I believe in. In addition, the same lack   
                of guidance that can be a source of frustration pushes me to explore and learn on my own, which I know sets me up to be more 
                flexible and capable in the future.
           </p>
            
          <p>
            The site is built with NodeJS and uses AWS and PostgreSQL to manage our users and databases.

          <h2 class="section-heading">TriNetX | Engineering Intern</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">January to August 2020 - Cambridge, MA</h3>

          <p>The first portion of this internship was during my Senior Spring, where I worked part time while also completing classes. 
              The majority of my time was spent implementing minor features and fixing bugs while familiarizing myself with my team's stack. 
          </p>

          <p>Over the summer, my focus shifted to developing a feature that would depict the set of comorbidities as a high level overview 
              for a selected population. I integreated this feature into our platform using D3 to build a bubble graph visualization and 
              Python for the computations on our stats server.
        </p>

        <p>
            The TriNetX platform uses React for the frontend, Java for the backend, a Python stats server, and Snowflake for database management.
        </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Navigant | Associate Consultant</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2019 - Washington, DC</h3>

          <p>My primary project as a part of the Energy & Capital Markets team was to rewrite their previously bug-ridden 
              Supply & Demand tool from the ground up. Given historical usage and market data and the set of changes to requirements 
              and infrastructure, the aim of the tool was to predict future energy demand for a region. I used Python for the necessary
              computations and PyQt for the GUI. 
          </p>
          <p>The independent nature of this work felt very unique for an internship, as I was tasked with doing technical work for a 
              non-technical team. It was over the course of this project that my love for coding was truly solidified. During the back half of
              the summer I spent pretty much all day every day working on my tool - and the hours would fly by. Having a job like this where 
              I was able to settle in and just <em>flow</em> helped me realize that this was the work I wanted to be filling my days with in
              the future, and when the summer ended I was sent back to school more motivated and focused than ever before.
        </p>

          <p> I used Tableau and Qlik to work on several different data analysis, visualization, and modeling projects.
               I assisted in the primary stages of design for a new tool to analyze and convey the quality of datasets.</p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2017 | Richmond, CA</h3>

          <p>The Summer after my freshman year I helped one of my close friends workshop the early stages of a photo print product / app idea. We spent 
              a good deal of time brainstorming and product testing in a local print facility, and even more time designing and implementing
              the interface of our user app. The product offically launched in October 2017, and although we were forced to shut down production 
              since none of us could commit to managing the operations, you can see my friend's post from the launch <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.assadi/posts/1440700265979056">here</a>. </p>
